/*
The processing package provides tools to process messages in a uniform way.
The package exposes two main processing interfaces: one based around messages
and one based around maps that contain the content of a message.

The former allows to index based on message metadata and parsing message by
schema, while the latter provides a simple interface to generically deal with
messages without adhering to a particular schema.
